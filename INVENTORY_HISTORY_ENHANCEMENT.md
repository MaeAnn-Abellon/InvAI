# Enhanced Inventory Status History with User Claims

## Overview
Enhanced the inventory status history functionality to show detailed information about users who claimed items, including claim approvals, rejections, and other status changes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Enhancements

#### Updated `listStatusHistory` Function
**File**: `backend/src/models/inventoryModel.js`

**Enhanced Query**: The status history now includes:
- **Regular Status Changes**: Traditional status transitions (available → in_use, etc.)
- **Claim Events**: User claims with approval/rejection information
- **User Information**: Full name, role, and email for all actions
- **Claim Details**: Quantity claimed and approval information

**New Data Structure**:
```sql
-- Status changes from inventory_item_status_history table
SELECT 
  h.id, h.item_id, h.old_status, h.new_status, h.changed_by, h.changed_at,
  u.full_name, u.role, u.email,
  'status_change' as actionType,
  NULL as claimQuantity, NULL as approvedByName
FROM inventory_item_status_history h
LEFT JOIN users u ON h.changed_by = u.id

UNION ALL

-- Claim events from inventory_claims table  
SELECT 
  NULL as id, c.item_id, NULL as old_status,
  CASE 
    WHEN c.status = 'approved' THEN 'claimed'
    WHEN c.status = 'rejected' THEN 'claim_rejected' 
    ELSE 'claim_pending'
  END as new_status,
  c.requested_by, COALESCE(c.decided_at, c.created_at),
  req_user.full_name, req_user.role, req_user.email,
  'claim' as actionType,
  c.quantity, app_user.full_name as approvedByName
FROM inventory_claims c
LEFT JOIN users req_user ON c.requested_by = req_user.id
LEFT JOIN users app_user ON c.approved_by = app_user.id
```

### 2. Frontend Enhancements

#### Updated History Modal Display
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/manager/InventoryPage.jsx`

**New Table Structure**:
- **Date**: When the action occurred
- **Action**: Visual badges showing claim status or status transitions
- **User**: Complete user information with name, role, and email
- **Details**: Additional context like quantities and approval information

**Visual Improvements**:
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded badges for different claim states
  - Green: Claimed (approved)
  - Red: Claim Rejected  
  - Yellow: Claim Pending
- **User Cards**: Rich user information display
- **Claim Details**: Quantity information and approver details

## Data Types Shown

### 1. Status Changes
- **Traditional transitions**: available → in_use, in_stock → out_of_stock, etc.
- **Shows**: User who made the change, timestamp, old and new status

### 2. User Claims
- **Claim Submitted**: When user requests an item
- **Claim Approved**: When manager approves the claim
- **Claim Rejected**: When manager rejects the claim
- **Shows**: 
  - Requester information (name, role, email)
  - Quantity requested
  - Approval/rejection details
  - Manager who decided (for approved/rejected claims)

## Visual Design

### Status Badges
```css
Claimed:       Green background (#dcfce7), green text (#166534)
Claim Rejected: Red background (#fee2e2), red text (#b91c1c)  
Claim Pending:  Yellow background (#fef9c3), yellow text (#92400e)
```

### User Information Display
- **Primary**: User's full name (bold)
- **Secondary**: Role and email (smaller, gray text)
- **Fallback**: "Unknown" for deleted users

### Claim Details
- **Quantity**: Shows number of items claimed
- **Approver**: Shows who approved/rejected (for decided claims)

## Usage

### For Managers
1. Navigate to Inventory Management page
2. Click "History" button on any inventory item
3. View comprehensive history including:
   - Who claimed the item and when
   - Who approved or rejected claims
   - All status changes with user information
   - Chronological order (newest first)

### Example History Entries
```
Date: 10/7/2025, 2:30 PM
Action: [Claimed] 
User: John Doe (Student • john.doe@email.com)
Details: Qty: 2, Approved by: Jane Manager

Date: 10/6/2025, 9:15 AM  
Action: available → in_use
User: Jane Manager (Manager • jane@email.com)
Details: Status change
```

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Integration
- Uses existing `inventory_item_status_history` table
- Uses existing `inventory_claims` table
- Uses existing `users` table
- No new tables or columns required

### Performance Considerations
- Single query with UNION for efficiency
- LEFT JOINs handle deleted users gracefully
- Ordered by timestamp for chronological display

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of deleted users (shows "Unknown")
- Handles missing data fields
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Benefits

1. **Complete Audit Trail**: Managers can see exactly who claimed what and when
2. **Accountability**: Clear record of all user actions
3. **Approval Tracking**: See who approved or rejected claims
4. **User Context**: Rich user information for better decision making
5. **Historical Insight**: Complete timeline of item lifecycle

This enhancement provides managers with comprehensive visibility into inventory usage patterns and user behavior, supporting better inventory management decisions.
