## Analytics Details

### Equipment Status Tracking

- **For Repair**: Equipment needing maintenance
- **Disposed**: Equipment no longer usable

- **Available**: Supplies in stock (mapped from 'in_stock' status)
- **In Use**: Supplies currently being consumed (if tracked)
- **For Repair**: Supplies needing attention (unusual but supported)
- **Disposed**: Supplies no longer usable

## Usage Across User Roles

### Students, Teachers, Staff
- Access via main Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- See both Equipment and Supplies status side-by-side
- Data filtered based on their department/course access

### Managers
- Access via Manager Dashboard 
- Full view of inventory they manage
- Additional utilization and activity analytics
- Equipment and Supplies breakdown in dedicated section

### Administrators
- Access via Admin Dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`)
- System-wide view of all inventory
- Equipment and Supplies analytics alongside other admin metrics
- Complete oversight of all categories and statuses

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. Each dashboard loads inventory items via `inventoryApi.listItems()`
2. StatusAnalytics component receives items array as prop
3. Component calculates status counts using useMemo for performance
4. Separate calculations for equipment and supplies categories
5. Real-time updates when inventory data changes

### Performance Considerations
- Uses React.useMemo for efficient recalculation
- Separate component allows for easy reuse
- Minimal re-renders with optimized dependencies

### Responsive Design
- Flexbox layout adapts to different screen sizes
- Charts and legends adjust automatically
- Mobile-friendly layout with proper spacing

## Future Enhancements
- Add drill-down capability to see specific items in each status
- Include trend analysis over time
- Add filtering by date ranges
- Include inventory value calculations by status
- Add export functionality for analytics data
